# AI-Research
This repository serves as a collection of AI research papers, with links to the original sources and concise summaries of their main topics and key takeaways. I will be continuously updating this page as I review more papers, covering various aspects of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and more. 

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest papers for review!
